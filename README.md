# Royal game of Ur

Quick implementation of the [Royal Game of Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Game_of_Ur) with OCaml and pure SDL/OpenGL.  
See also this great [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZskjLq040I) demonstrating the original game.

Depends on :
- `tsdl`
- `tgls`

Usage :

- Build : `dune build ur.exe`
- Run : `dune exec ./ur.exe`
- Follow instructions on screen (play with numbers on your keyboard)
